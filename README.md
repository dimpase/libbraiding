# libbraiding

This is a project to expose the functionalitis of the _Braiding_ program 
as a shared library. The original goal is to include it as a component of
[SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org), but it can be used in any other c++
program.

This code is maintained by **[Miguel Marco-Buzunariz](https://riemann.unizar.es/~mmarco)**,
as a fork of the one maintained by **[Jean-Luc 
Thiffeault](http://www.math.wisc.edu/~jeanluc)**.

_CBraid_ is a C++ library originally written by **[Jae Choon 
Cha](http://gt.postech.ac.kr/~jccha/)**.  
It allows various computations on braid groups, such as normal forms.  The code 
in this project is based on his final version of 2001/12/07 and distributed 
under the GPL.

The library has been updated to run on modern compilers, and has been merged 
with _Braiding_ version v1.0 (2004/10/04) originally written by **[Juan 
Gonzalez-Meneses](http://personal.us.es/meneses/)** and distributed under the 
GPL.  Maria Cumplido contributed some code for computing sets of sliding 
circuits.
